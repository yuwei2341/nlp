They ask you what is permitted for them. Say, “Permitted for you are all good things, including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you.” You train them according to what Allah has taught you. So eat from what they catch for you, and pronounce Allah’s name over it. And fear Allah. Allah is Swift in reckoning.
