Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain victory from Allah, they say, “Were we not with you?” But if the disbelievers get a turn, they say, “Did we not side with you, and defend you from the believers?” Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection; and Allah will give the disbelievers no means of overcoming the believers.
