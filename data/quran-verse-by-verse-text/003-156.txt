O you who believe! Do not be like those who disbelieved, and said of their brethren who marched in the land, or went on the offensive, “Had they stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” So that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. Allah gives life and causes death. Allah is Seeing of what you do.
