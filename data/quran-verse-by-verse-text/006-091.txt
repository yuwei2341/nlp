They do not value Allah as He should be valued, when they say, “Allah did not reveal anything to any human being.” Say, “Who revealed the Scripture which Moses brought—a light and guidance for humanity?” You put it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing much. And you were taught what you did not know—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say, “Allah;” then leave them toying away in their speculation.
