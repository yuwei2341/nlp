Their prophet said to them, “Allah has appointed Saul to be your king.” They said, “How can he have authority over us, when we are more worthy of authority than he, and he was not given plenty of wealth?” He said, “Allah has chosen him over you, and has increased him in knowledge and stature.” Allah bestows His sovereignty upon whomever He wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.
