“We would be fabricating falsehood against Allah, if we were to return to your religion, after Allah has saved us from it. It is not for us to return to it, unless Allah, our Lord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in knowledge. In Allah we place our trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.”
