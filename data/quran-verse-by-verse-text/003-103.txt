And hold fast to the rope of Allah, altogether, and do not become divided. And remember Allahâ€™s blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts, and by His grace you became brethren. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. Allah thus clarifies His revelations for you, so that you may be guided.
