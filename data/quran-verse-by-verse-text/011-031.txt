“I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the future, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of those who are despicable in your eyes that Allah will never give them any good. Allah is Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I would be one of the wrongdoers.”
