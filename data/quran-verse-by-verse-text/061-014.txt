O you who believe! Be supporters of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, “Who are my supporters towards Allah?” The disciples said, “We are Allah's supporters.” So a group of the Children of Israel believed, while another group disbelieved. We supported those who believed against their foe, so they became dominant.
