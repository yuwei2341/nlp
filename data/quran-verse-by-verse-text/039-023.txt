Allah has sent down the best of narrations: a Scripture consistent and paired. The skins of those who reverence their Lord shiver from it, then their skins and their hearts soften up to the remembrance of Allah. Such is Allahâ€™s guidance; He guides with it whomever He wills. But whomever Allah leaves astray, for him there is no guide.
