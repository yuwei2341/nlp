Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you, and His mercy, a faction of them would have managed to mislead you. But they only mislead themselves, and they cannot harm you in any way. Allah has revealed to you the Scripture and wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Allah’s goodness towards you is great.
