Not equal are the inactive among the believers—except the disabled—and the strivers in the cause of Allah with their possessions and their persons. Allah prefers the strivers with their possessions and their persons above the inactive, by a degree. But Allah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward.
