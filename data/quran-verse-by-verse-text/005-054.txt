O you who believe! Whoever of you goes back on his religionâ€”Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, kind towards the believers, stern with the disbelievers. They strive in the way of Allah, and do not fear the blame of the critic. That is the grace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever He wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.
