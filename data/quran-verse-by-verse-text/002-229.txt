Divorce is allowed twice. Then, either honorable retention, or setting free kindly. It is not lawful for you to take back anything you have given them, unless they fear that they cannot maintain Allah's limits. If you fear that they cannot maintain Allah’s limits, then there is no blame on them if she sacrifices something for her release. These are Allah’s limits, so do not transgress them. Those who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.
