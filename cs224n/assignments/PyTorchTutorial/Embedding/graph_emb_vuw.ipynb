    "# Computing Exact Graph Embeddings with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will learn how to solve the graph reconstruction problem using PyTorch. We will reconstruct our graph's full adjacency matrix, and we will frame this problem as a logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namely, we want to ask, given two node IDs, is there going to be an edge between them or not? This would be a classical logistic regression problem, **if only we had some features!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that we can **learn our own features** to solve this problem. To a social scientist this notion may seem a bit counter-intuitive. How can we learn about variables (\"features\") we did not even have an idea existed?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to understand the feature learning approach is to think about the missing data problem. There are many techniques to do imputation of missing values in survey datasets for instance. In a sense, this is what we'll be doing, only that we will be imputing values over entire columns of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem a bit like black magic. Normally, when we impute missing data, we look at existing values in our data matrix for guidance on what values we should assign to empty cells. In our case the only information we have is whether there exists a tie between two edges or not. As it turns out, this is enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For every node $i$ we assume there exists a vector $\\vec{v}_i$ of dimensionality $d$. This vector is the *feature vector* and will encode all the information we learn about the node's participation in the graph. We will randomly sample pairs of nodes $(i, j)$ from the graph's adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $Y_{i, j}$ an indicator variable denoting the existence of an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$. We will then write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_{i, j} = \\mathrm{sigmoid}(\\vec{v}_i \\cdot \\vec{v}_j) + \\epsilon_{i, j}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathrm{sigmoid}$ is the sigmoid function, $\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will seek to reduce the values of $\\epsilon_{i, j}$ as much as possible, under certain constraints expressed by a  **loss function**. In our case (logistic regression), this simply the [log loss](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Log_Loss) function, also known among neural network researchers as the **binary cross entropy loss**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = - \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} y_{i, j} \\log{p_{i, j}} + (1-y_{i, j})\\log({1-p_{i,j}}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p_{i, j} = \\mathrm{sigmoid}(\\vec{v}_i \\cdot \\vec{v}_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $L$ presented above is an unweighted loss. Such a loss quantifies how well we're doing at predicting our edges. Most real-world graphs are sparse, however, meaning they have many fewer 1s than 0s in their adjacency matrices. In this case, we will want to compute a *weighted* loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = - \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} w_{i, j} \\big[y_{i, j} \\log{p_{i, j}} + (1-y_{i, j})(\\log{1-p_{i,j}})\\big] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of introducing $w_{i, j}$ is to ensure that doing poorly at predicting 1s in our matrix is penalized just as heavily as doing poorly at predicting 0s. Thus if $N_0$ and $N_1$ quantify the number of 1s and 0s in our adjacency matrix, then we can set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{i, j} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & Y_{i, j} = 1 \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{N_1}{N_0} & Y_{i, j} = 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the apparatus behind our loss function, let's take a look at how we will be computing the values of this function in practice. For now we won't worry about how we will actually minimize this loss, nor will we pay much attention to computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing `torch` and `numpy`, the two packages we will use heavily in this tutorial."

    "\n",
    "The mini-batch SGD algorithm requires us to make a small step in the direction indicated by the gradient. The step has a \"width\" $\\alpha$, also known as the **learning rate**. The gradient tells us how much the loss *increases* if we increase a parameter by $\\alpha$. Thus, to minimize the loss, we will move in the opposite direction of the gradient. We will update all vectors $\\vec{v_i}$ using this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{v}_i := \\vec{v}_i - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\vec{v_i}} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ L = - \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} w_{i, j} \\times \\textrm{BCE}(y_{i, j}, \\textrm{sig}(\\vec{v_{i}} \\cdot \\vec{v_{j}})) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To take the derivative $ \\partial L / \\partial \\vec{v_i} $, we need to go back to elementary calculus and remember that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the terms' derivatives, and that $w_{i, j}$ is a constant that does not depend on $\\vec{v_i}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\vec{v_i}} = - \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} w_{i, j} \\partial \\frac{\\textrm{BCE}(y_{i, j}, \\textrm{sig}(\\vec{v_{i}} \\cdot \\vec{v_{j}}))}{\\partial \\vec{v_i}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, this was the easy part. Now we need to get the gradient of the binary cross-entropy function with respect to our vector. To do so, we can enlist the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule), which stipulates that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x))g'(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a long and rather tedious exercise to go into exactly how the chain rule is applied in our particular case, but suffice to say that for certain derivatives $f'(x)$ you need to know what the value of $x$ is in order to compute the derivative. But note how we have already computed our loss: for every function along the chain leading to our final loss value, we had to compute this $x$. The `Variable` class \"remembers\" this value where applicable, and uses it to give back a gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, `Variables` can only be subject to differentiable operations, the logic for which has to be implemented and optimized. But there are a lot of differentiable operations available in PyTorch -- and because of the chain rule, `Variable`s can be composed into the endlessly complex chains of operations that power modern AI models.\n",

    "- sampling negatives: notice how we have considered all the 0s when setting up our dataset. Ordinarily we would only consider about as many 0s as 1s. Note that sampling at random will not be a good idea, since in that case we'd just learn which nodes have high degree. There's an entire science to figuring out how to pick the right sample of negatives -- things could get really complicated if we were embedding weighted graphs, signed graphs or hypergraphs!\n",
    "- regularization: we would likely also want to apply some sort of regularization to our parameters if we will increase the dimensionality of our space, to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- \"shingling\": for very large graphs, sampling negatives is not enough to make the problem tractable. We are bound by however many 32-bit floats can fit in our GPU's memory. There are however techniques for breaking this problem down into smaller sub-problems, which can all fit into memory."
