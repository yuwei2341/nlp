You know, what I do is write for children,  and I'm probably America's  most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people  that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,  and no one has ever chose farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you  about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany  is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You've just got to go around the block  to see it as an epiphany.
That's a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It's the kind of complicated circle  that I'm going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the '60s  in high school in Stow, Ohio  where I was the class queer.
